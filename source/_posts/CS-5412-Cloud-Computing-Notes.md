	- CAP: you can have just two from Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance 
	- ACID Model: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability
	- BASE Methodology: Basically Available Soft-StateServices with Eventual Consistency
- Time
	- Happens before relation
	- Logic clock
	- Vector clock
	- Temporal distortions
	- Consistent cut
	- Snapshots: Chandy/Lamport Algorithm
	- Phantom Deadlock
- 2PC
- 3PC: without any log service, and with accurate failure detection is non-blocking
- Causes of delay in the cloud
	- Scheduling
	- A node might get a burst of messages that overflow its input sockets and triggers message loss, or network could have some kind of malfunction in its routers/links
	- A machine might become overloaded and slow because too many virtual machines were mapped on it
	- An application might run wild and page heavily
- FLP theorem
	- Impossibility of Asynchronous Distributed Consensus witha Single Faulty Process
	- No asynchronous algorithm for agreeing on a one-bit value can guarantee that it will terminate in the presence of crash faults
	- FLP proves that any fault-tolerant algorithm solving consensus has runs that never terminate
	-  Failstop failure 
	- Byzantine failure
		- need at least 3f+1 processes and f+1 “rounds” in a system to tolerate f Byzantine failure
		- Send messages with digital signatures all along and add one more round for communicating wtiness messages to expose corrupted process, though the overheads are high
		- “Early stopping” protocols: min(t+2, f+1) rounds; t is true number of faults
		- current research
			- Byzantine Quorums
			- Split secrets
			- Byzantine Broadcast
- Paxos
	-  To tolerate ≤ t failures, deploy 2t+1 replicas (e.g. Paxos with 3 replicas can tolerate 1 failure)
	-  Quorum
	-  Leader, acceptor, learner
	-  Ballot numbers and slot
